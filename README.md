# cert-manager-webhook-all-inkl
A {cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) [webhook](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/webhook/) for [all-inkl.com](https://all-inkl.com/) hosting

The library is based on the [official example](https://github.com/cert-manager/webhook-example) from cert-manager.

## How to use

The webhook is meant to be run on a kubernetes cluster. It uses kubernetes apis to register a webhook and will not work without.

### Deploy with Helm

An OCI helm chart is published as part of the [ghcr packages](https://github.com/johnnycube/cert-manager-webhook-all-inkl/pkgs/container/allinkl-webhook)

To install use your favourite helm tool:

```bash
helm install allinkl-webhook oci://ghcr.io/johnnycube/allinkl-webhook-helm --version 0.1.0
```

### Create (Cluster-) Issuer and Certificate

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: excample-com-tls
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  secretName: demo-tls
  dnsNames:
    - example.com
  issuerRef:
    name: allinkl-issuer # or Issuer with kind: Issuer
    kind: ClusterIssuer
```

The referenced credentials have to be deployed in a secret readable by the Service Acount used by the webhook. `cert-manager` is the default namespace. This is also the namespace used for ClusterIssuers.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: allinkl-issuer
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  acme:
    email: test@example.com # Change to your letsencrypt email
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory # Change for productive
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: allinkl-webhook-account-key
    solvers:
      - dns01:
          webhook:
            groupName: acme.johanneskueber.com
            solverName: allinkl
            config:
              usernameKeySecretRef:
                name: allinkl-credentials
                key: username
              passwordKeySecretRef:
                name: allinkl-credentials
                key: password
```

Username and password are the credentials for your [KAS](https://kas.all-inkl.com/).


### Use with Ingress / Gateway API

Cert manager can automate the creation of certificates when used in conjuntion with the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). To use this feature your gateway needs to be annotated with a cert-manager specific annotation. Also don't forget to activate the [gateway API support](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/gateway/) of cert-manager - deactivated by default on older versions.

```yaml
---
# Gateway for *.example.com
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gw-example
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: allinkl-issuer # or Issuer with annotation: cert-manager.io/issuer
spec:
  gatewayClassName: traefik # adept to your gwc
  listeners:
    - name: https
      protocol: HTTPS
      port: 443
      hostname: "*.example.com"
      tls:
        mode: Terminate
        certificateRefs:
          - kind: Secret
            name: wildcard-example-com-tls
            namespace: default
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: All
```

## Road to 1.0

* [] Add (unit) tests
* [] Ensure that the cert-manager testsuite is running
* [] Proper documentation / README.md
* [] Describe solution RBAC for ServiceAccount in Helm
